## About

The goal of this repository is to document my journey in learning and practicing C++. It includes projects that demonstrate my understanding of fundamental and advanced concepts, such as:

- Object-oriented programming (OOP)
- Data structures and algorithms
- File handling
- Memory management
- Advanced C++ features (e.g., templates, STL, etc.)

Each project is accompanied by code comments and, where applicable, additional documentation to explain the implementation.
